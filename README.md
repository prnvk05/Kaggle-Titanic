# Kaggle-Titanic
This is a documentation of a Random Forests based approach to solve the 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster' problem on Kaggle (python).


The goal of this problem is to analyse the data provided and to predict what sort of passengers survived the disaster.

 I used the Random Forests algorithm to solve this problem. Random Forests are an ensemble learning method for regression or classification. They are constructed using several decision trees and can correct for overfitting that may occur with the use of decision trees.

Dependencies:

1.numpy
2.pandas
3.sklearn
